## About Mercury

**Mercury** is a cutting-edge proof-of-concept developed during the [8th CASSINI Hackathon](https://www.cassini.eu/hackathons/), an initiative supported by the **EUSPA (EU Agency for the Space Programme)**. This project showcases an innovative approach to leveraging European space technologies, specifically IRIS2 and Galileo, for secure communication and operational efficiency in unmanned drone applications.

## Hackathon Challenge

### Challenge #2: Unmanned Drone Applications for Defence & Security Operations

> *"Drones hold great potential for defence, security, and civil protection, benefiting European society and creating jobs. The European drone sector is projected to generate over â‚¬10 billion annually in services within 20 years. Situational awareness and incident tracking are crucial for defence, surveillance, and rescue services."*

Mercury addresses the challenge by providing impactful solutions in:
- **Information Gathering:** Systems for real-time data during defence, security, and civil operations.
- **Responder Safety:** Improving safety in defence, wildfires, and natural disasters.
- **Drone Cybersecurity:** Mitigating security risks in drone tracking, communication, and positioning.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring the accuracy of drone-collected data.
- **Misuse Prevention:** Detecting and responding to drone misuse, enhancing public safety.
